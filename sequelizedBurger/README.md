# Eat-Da-Burger

## Overview

This project is an application that stores a database of burgers to eat.  You can add new burgers by submitting them in the form.  Once added, they are separated into those that are not devoured yet (on the left side) and those that already are devoured (on the right side).  If you click on the "Devour It!" button next to the burger, the state changes from not devoured to devoured in the database and on the webpage.  The project is deployed on Heroku and can be found here: https://secret-crag-23841.herokuapp.com/. 

## Technical Approach
I used express routing and ajax get and post requests to route to the main page. I used handlebars to create web templates.  I used mysql to store the data on the backend. I used the model view controller methodology to create separations of concerns.
